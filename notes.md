# CS260 Notes

## Assignment 1 Reflection
For this first assignment, I learned how to clone a repository, commit a repository, and push a repository. I also learned other basic navigation tools/commands of GitHub, like `git add`, `git fetch`, `git status`, etc. through the reading given. I also learned some basic markdown syntax for GitHub files like this.

I learned that files, directories, and even code can be manipulated in a terminal. At its core, the terminal (like git bash, for example) is the stripped down version of a PC's software. Once it's mastered, I can be a much more efficient developer, as well as have newer, beter ways of navigating my way around my PC.
