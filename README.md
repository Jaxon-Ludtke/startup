# BuildSync

[My Notes](notes.md)

This is an application built for salesmen for a building company. A common issue they have is displaying data to the realtors they work with in an efficient manner. Data about featured homes, prices, HOA information, incentives for different communities, etc. are all in scattered locations (multiple emails, different websites, google sheets, PDF's, etc.). Some of this data is updated and changed daily, which adds to the confusion.

The function of the application is to aggregate data from all of these sources into one dashboard, so the salesmen and realtors can see this data in an organized manner. The result will be significant time reduction in providing information and value, more clarity and less hassle, and ease of access for this data for both the salesmen and realtors, which in turn will create more business.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever found yourself spending an endless amount of time searching for home information when speaking with realtors, or wish realtors could view a dashboard with all the information for available homes in one place? The BuildSync application allows for the aggregation of scattered data to be populated in a practical and professional dashboard. The result will be a massive reduction in hunting for information and increased time for networking & selling, continuous updates for all parties (realtors and salesmen) on a live dashboard so everyone stays up to date automatically, and ultimately an easier, quicker, and hassle-free experience for clients searching to buy homes.
